We just published our local git repo(repository)
to remote GitHub.com repository
Few thing happened :
1. It automatically created new Remote Repo 
	under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo


Now our work will continue locally

1. add a new file called note.txt
2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository
so we PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button
4. observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com

How to save after adding some text in sublime
On Mac Command + S
or Click on File  --> Save


We do not have to push one commit at a time
You can push multiple commits in one shot
There is no limit

you cannot undo what already push but
you can undo the last commit that happend

If you have commit in changes tab you donot
wish to commit you can right click and select discard changed,
It will also remove it from the sublime

If you have commit that you did not push yet, 
you have option to undo last commit by
Clicking on undo button right under Commit to
master button (IT WILL NOT SHOW UP IF YOU ALREADY PUSHED)

*try not to deleted any on GitHub.com just do it on the 
git local.
